# Polyglot Advent

I was convinced to attempt the advent of code in a variety of
programming languages. One programming language a problem / day.

## Available languages

 - APL
 - Agda
 - Assembly (NASM x64) - [Solution for day 01](./01-assembly)
 - C
 - C++
 - COBOL - [Solution for day 03](./03-cobol)
 - Erlang
 - Go
 - Haskell
 - Idris
 - Java
 - Julia
 - (La)TeX
 - Nim
 - OCaml
 - PHP
 - Python - [Solution for day 02](./02-python)
 - Racket
 - Ruby
 - Rust
 - SQL
 - Scheme
 - GLSL Shaders
 - Smalltalk
 - Solidity (Ethereum blockchain stuff. No clue how this works.)
 - Typescript

## Rules

 - No time limits / having to complete everything by a certain
   date. (Actually I'm starting late so I have a backlog of items to
   go through. I'd like to finish before 2021 though).
 - The goal is learning stuff and having fun. It's not about writing the
   most efficient or most idiomatic code possible. I just want to get a
   small tour of what all these languages can provide.
 - I can choose which language I want to use for a given problem.
 - I cannot use a single language for more than one problem.
 - The list of languages is subject to change, depending on whims, mood,
   and difficulties that I encounter.

Should be fun! Onwards we go :)
