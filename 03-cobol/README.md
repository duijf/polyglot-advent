I first tried searching for written tutorials or courses, but couldn't find
anything with the right focus (a lot of stuff assumed that you wanted to run
COBOL on an IBM mainframe of some sort).

This is the stuff that did work for me:

 - The [GNU Cobol website][cobol-website]. This was hard to find. For some
   reason, the [SourceForge page][cobol-sourceforge] is ranked higher in
   Google results while containing less useful information.
 - The [GNU Cobol's programmers manual][cobol-manual]. This is too dense
   for learning, but seems like a nice exhaustive reference.
 - This [Youtube video][cobol-youtube] was a nice intro to actually getting
   started with the language from scratch, learning what features it has
   and seeing lots of examples quickly.
