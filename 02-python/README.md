# Challenge 2 - Python

I was kind of tired of the NASM edition and wanted to write this
challenge in a higher level language. Let's just do it in Python
becaues I know it well.

I might be shooting myself in the foot here because I'm removing
Python from the possible languages in the future. I guess we'll
see how this is going to work out.

## Things learned

Nothing really, this was just a matter of writing down the spec.

## How to run

```
# Run
$ ./solution.py

# Typecheck
$ mypy --strict solution.py
```
